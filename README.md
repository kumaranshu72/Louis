<h3> What is Louis </h3>
<p>
An application is a coded program built to aid people in performing various activities. An
application is therefore different from a utility (which carries out maintenance or multi-
purpose tasks), an operating system (which manages a computer), and programming
tools (which are used to create computer applications). They are designed keeping in
mind the specific activity which it needs to accomplish. Therefore, our aim was to build
an application specifically designed for differently abled people. In today’s world of
technology where all the tech giants whether it be Google, Apple or Microsoft are
focused on evolving technology for modern generation to make this world a better place,
but it is more than often the case that none of these pioneers ever focus on the welfare of
the people who are differently abled. Hence, we came up with this idea to create a Linux
based software, so that differently abled people no longer require the need/help of other
people to operate a computer. We named our application Louis after Louis Braille, the
inventor of Braille script. It is a software which will help these people in performing day
to day tasks carried out using a computer such as reading a file, writing a document,
searching the web, listening to music or using a calculator. Since, differently abled people
often face difficulty in using input devices such as a keyboard or a mouse. So, the input
mode that our application uses is voice input. All the commands are given by the user via
voice commands by pressing a predefined key and since blind people can’t make use of
output device such as a monitor to see the results, each of the utility in our application
provides a voice output for each of the query made by the user. Even the login module
uses voice authentication, i.e. make use of pre-recorded user voice samples to
authenticate the user. Thus, creating a final product which is easy to use for differently
abled people so that they no longer have to rely on other people to use a computer.
